Softbloks Version 0.0 30/12/2014
================================

What is Softbloks?
------------------

Softbloks is a free ---in the sense of *free speech*, not of *free beer*---
cross-platform SDK inspired by [Phonebloks](http://phonebloks.com), a modular
smartphone concept. The aim of Softbloks is to provide a modular design for
software development. We ---the developpers of Softbloks--- are not part of
the Phonebloks team. We just found the concept inspiring and the Phonebloks
team kindly allowed us to use a *bloks* name.
